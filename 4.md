### Q.8
Deploy a pod with the following specifications:

**Pod name:** web-pod  
**Image:** httpd  
**Node:** Node01  
**Note:** do not modify any settings on master and worker nodes  

**Weightage:** 6%

### Answer:
1. **Check existing taints on Node01** (if any):
   ```sh
   kubectl describe node Node01 | grep "Taints"
   ```

2. **If needed, add a taint to Node01** (skip if taint already exists):
   ```sh
   kubectl taint nodes Node01 key=value:NoSchedule
   ```
   *(Replace `key=value` with an appropriate key-value pair if required.)*

3. **Create a YAML file named `web-pod.yaml` with a toleration**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: web-pod
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: web-container
       image: httpd
     tolerations:
     - key: "key"
       operator: "Equal"
       value: "value"
       effect: "NoSchedule"
   ```

4. **Apply the YAML file to create the pod**:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f web-pod.yaml
   ```

5. **Verify that the pod is scheduled correctly**:
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -o wide
   ```

6. **Confirm the pod is running on Node01**:
   ```sh
   kubectl describe pod web-pod | grep "Node:"
   ```

### Notes:
- If Node01 already has a taint, use the same key-value pair in the toleration.
- The pod will only be scheduled on a tainted node if it has the correct toleration.
