### **Q.27 - Upgrade Kubernetes Cluster from 1.26.0 to 1.27.0**
#### **Task:**
- Upgrade the **master (control plane) node** and **worker node** from **Kubernetes v1.26.0** to **v1.27.0**.
- **Drain the nodes before upgrading**.
- **Uncordon the nodes after the upgrade**.

---

### **1. Check the Current Kubernetes Version**
```sh
kubectl version --short
```
Expected output:
```
Client Version: v1.26.0
Server Version: v1.26.0
```

---

### **2. Drain the Master Node**
Before upgrading, safely evict pods from the **control plane**:
```sh
kubectl drain master-node --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
```
- This ensures all non-daemonset workloads are moved elsewhere.

---

### **3. Upgrade the Kubernetes Control Plane**
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kubeadm=1.27.0-00
```

#### **Upgrade the Cluster**
```sh
sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.27.0
```
- The `plan` command shows **what will be upgraded**.
- The `apply` command performs the **actual upgrade**.

#### **Verify the Control Plane Upgrade**
```sh
kubectl get nodes
kubectl version --short
```
Ensure the master node is now running **v1.27.0**.

---

### **4. Uncordon the Master Node**
```sh
kubectl uncordon master-node
```
- This allows new pods to be scheduled on the master again.

---

### **5. Drain the Worker Node (`kworker`)**
```sh
kubectl drain kworker --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
```

---

### **6. Upgrade the Worker Node**
Run these commands on the **worker node**:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kubeadm=1.27.0-00
sudo kubeadm upgrade node
```

---

### **7. Upgrade Kubelet & Kubectl on Both Nodes**
```sh
sudo apt install -y kubelet=1.27.0-00 kubectl=1.27.0-00
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

---

### **8. Uncordon the Worker Node**
```sh
kubectl uncordon kworker
```
- This allows new workloads to be scheduled on the worker node.

---

### **9. Verify the Upgrade**
```sh
kubectl get nodes
kubectl version --short
```
Ensure **all nodes** are running **v1.27.0**.

---

### **Conclusion**
**Successfully upgraded Kubernetes from 1.26.0 to 1.27.0.**  
**Drained and uncordoned both master and worker nodes.**  
**Cluster upgrade completed safely!**
