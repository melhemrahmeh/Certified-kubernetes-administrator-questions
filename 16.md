### **Ingress Create**
#### **Create Services for existing Deployments**

There are two existing **Deployments** in **Namespace `world`** that should be made accessible via an **Ingress**.

#### **Step 1: Create ClusterIP Services for both Deployments**
- **Expose each Deployment as a Service** on **port 80**.
- **The Services should have the same name as the Deployments**.

---

### **Solution: YAML for ClusterIP Services**
Assuming the **Deployments are named `deploy1` and `deploy2`**, create the following services:

Save as `services.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: deploy1
  namespace: world
spec:
  selector:
    app: deploy1
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: deploy2
  namespace: world
spec:
  selector:
    app: deploy2
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

Apply the YAML:
```sh
kubectl apply -f services.yaml
```

---

### **Verify the Services**
```sh
kubectl get svc -n world
```
Ensure both services (`deploy1` and `deploy2`) exist and are of **type `ClusterIP`**.

---

### **Next Steps**
- Create an **Ingress resource** to expose these services externally.
- Configure **Ingress rules** to route traffic to `deploy1` and `deploy2`.

**Services are now ready for Ingress!**
