### **Q.25 - Create a Deployment and Cordon `kworker`**
#### **Task:**
- Create a **Deployment** named `web`.
- Use the **image**: `nginx:1.16`.
- Set **replicas** to `3`.
- **Ensure no pods are scheduled on `kworker` by cordoning the node**.

---

### **1. Cordon the Node `kworker`**
Cordoning the node will prevent new pods from being scheduled but will not evict existing ones.

```sh
kubectl cordon kworker
```
Expected output:
```
node/kworker cordoned
```

---

### **2. Create the Deployment YAML**
Save the following YAML as `web-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:1.16
```

Apply the Deployment:
```sh
kubectl apply -f web-deployment.yaml
```

---

### **3. Verify the Node is Cordoned**
Check the status of `kworker`:
```sh
kubectl get nodes
```
- `kworker` should have a `SchedulingDisabled` status.

---

### **4. Verify Pods Are Not on `kworker`**
```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
- Ensure the **web** pods are not scheduled on `kworker`.

---

### **5. Uncordon the Node (if needed)**
If you want to **allow scheduling on `kworker`** again, uncordon it:
```sh
kubectl uncordon kworker
```
Expected output:
```
node/kworker uncordoned
```

---

### **Conclusion**
**Created a Deployment named `web` with `nginx:1.16`.**  
**Cordoned `kworker` to prevent scheduling.**  
**Successfully restricted pod scheduling using `kubectl cordon`!**
